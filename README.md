Swirl:

1. A ball moves and there is a hole in middle. player should prevent it from falling in the hole:
  It usually takes a long time for ball to go in the direction of ball
2. Let's do it the other way. Player should guild it to the hole.
3. Having a level which you will pick object to get score. Having extra point for keeping the ball in control.


Twin Skaters:

1. Vertical scrolling game. Two skates moving upward. They can get close together, apart from each other, move left or right together.


Elements:

1. Turn based strategy game. With four elements you can create a warrior. Warriors can move,attack,add elements to themselves, split and merge. Guessing the opponent's strategy can lead to winning.
2. The element do not only represent the power of the warrior, they are also the resources. Each extra move needs 1 air, each attack needs a move and 1 fire. Adding elements needs 1 earth. Merge and split needs 1 water.
3. The type of warrior is not as affecting as it should be. The cell warrior is on can affect the strength of the warrior if it is of the same type.
4. Giving extra properties to some of the board cells, such as extra resources or free add, merge and split functions.


Flip:

1. A puzzle game with tiles in the board. The player should connect to point to eachother. The function is fliping a tile, on vertical or horizontal axis.
